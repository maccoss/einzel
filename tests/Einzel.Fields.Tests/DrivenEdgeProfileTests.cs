/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// An edge profile carries its volts in its <em>profile</em> rather than in a scalar
/// potential, and every shipped one leaves that scalar null - the mirror pair's boards and
/// the Astral's are written that way. The channel decomposition builds a supply from the
/// scalar potential and the taps, so an edge profile joined no supply, appeared in no
/// pattern, and was weighted at zero; the rasteriser multiplies the profile by that weight,
/// so the board was simply not in the solve.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It never showed because the two templates that use edge profiles declare no drive.</b>
/// An undriven solve takes the other arm, where the scale is 1.0 and the profile is used as
/// written, so both are correct today. The defect is reached by declaring a drive on a
/// geometry that also has a profiled board - which is what an ejection slot with an
/// extraction plate behind it needs.

/// The measurement that caught it was a flight time against a closed form: a 1 eV ion in a
/// box whose right edge was held at -500 V crossed 4 mm in 6.419 us with a drive declared,
/// against the 6.44 us of field-free flight at 621.2 m/s. The plate was exactly absent.
