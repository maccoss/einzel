/// <para>
/// <b>While this template's electrodes were flat annuli</b> the trap lost its ion in a narrow
/// band at 605-614 V, sixty volts inside what the Mathieu chart calls stable. Every control
/// said it was real - identical at twice the mesh and twice the hold, absent at a quarter of
/// the hold and absent at a third of the launch offset - but a scan over amplitude can only
/// say <em>that</em> there is a band. A nonlinear resonance is <strong>defined</strong> by a
/// frequency condition, <c>n_z beta_z + n_r beta_r = 2</c> for a multipole of order
/// <c>n_z + n_r</c>, so naming one means measuring the frequencies.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The answer was the octupole.</b> At the band center the measured exponents were
/// beta_z = 0.6769 and beta_r = 0.3225, and <c>2 beta_z + 2 beta_r = 1.9989</c> - an
/// order-four condition met to 0.055 percent, against 0.22 and 0.10 at the amplitudes
/// either side. Order four is an octupole, which is precisely the leading unwanted multipole
/// this geometry's symmetry permits: the trap is symmetric about its own center plane and
/// about the axis, so every odd order vanishes. The identification was predicted before it
/// was fitted.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The electrodes are hyperboloids now, and the band is gone</b> - which is a stronger
/// confirmation of that identification than the fit was. An octupole is what a flat annulus
/// buys, so an account blaming the octupole predicts that giving the trap its real surfaces
/// removes the band; scanned at four volts from 560 to 730, every amplitude below the
/// ejection edge holds its ion. And the frequency condition goes with it: at the old band
/// center the best even condition now misses 2 by 0.22, where it was met to 0.0011. Two
/// independent signatures, both gone together.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// What remains of the octupole is measurable and small: the curvature ratio in
