    // depends on it strongly, which is the anharmonicity measured above doing its
    // work. It also means the edge cannot be reduced to the effective radius alone:
    // the scale factor predicts 0.828, which matches the 0.3 mm figure and not the
    // 0.1 mm one, so that agreement is partly coincidence. A measurement that only
    // reaches an electrode by growing to z0 is never a small-amplitude measurement,
    // whatever it was launched at.
    //
    // The finite window, which is the part worth remembering. At 60 cycles the
    // boundary is not a boundary at all but a ragged strip: confined at 674, lost at
    // 676 and 678, confined again at 680, lost at 682, confined at 684, and so on to
    // a solid loss from 690. At 200 cycles the same scan is a clean step. Nothing
    // about the design changed - the growth rate goes to zero at the stability edge,
    // so whether a marginally unstable ion reaches an electrode inside the hold is a
    // property of the hold. A boundary quoted without its observation window is not
    // quoted.
    //
    // And a narrow band of loss at 605 to 614 V (q_z = 0.739 to 0.750), well inside
    // the stable region. Every control says it is real: identical at 256 x 128,
    // identical at 400 cycles, absent at 60 (so the growth is slow and secular
    // rather than exponential), and absent at a 0.1 mm launch (so it is driven by
    // the field's higher multipoles, which a linear boundary cannot be). Which
    // resonance it is is NOT established - beta_z there is 0.615, which lands on no
    // n_z beta_z + n_r beta_r = 2 for any multipole order up to six - and settling
    // that needs a frequency analysis of the secular motion rather than a loss test.
    //
    // That band is also why BoundarySearch now walks outward from its converged
    // bracket. It found this one on its first real use, from a bracket whose
    // bisection had converged cleanly onto the main edge 60 V above it.
