# Model format, schema 0.3

A model is declarative, schema-validated, diffable JSON. A model file plus its
referenced artifacts fully determines a run.

Two rules govern the whole format:

**Every quantity carries a unit.** `{"value": 4, "unit": "kV"}`, never `4000`.
This is deliberately more annoying than the alternative, because unit ambiguity
is the commonest source of silent wrongness and an agent building a model from
prose is the actor most likely to introduce it. Making a quantity a two-field
object means the failure happens at parse time with a JSON Pointer rather than at
run time as a factor of 1.602e-19.

**Unit symbols are case-sensitive.** `mm` and `Mm` differ by nine orders of
magnitude. A wrong case is an error that names the right symbol, not a silent
acceptance.

## Skeleton

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.2",
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "parameters": { },
  "ion":        { },
  "source":     { },
  "fields":     [ ],
  "detector":   { },
  "transport":  { }
}
```

## Quantities

```json
{ "value": 4, "unit": "kV" }
{ "expression": "mirrorDepth * 0.5", "unit": "mm" }
```

Any quantity may be an expression over the declared parameters. Vectors are
`{"value": [x, y, z], "unit": "mm"}`; directions are `{"value": [1, 0, 0]}` with
no unit, normalised on load, so `[2,0,0]` and `[1,0,0]` mean the same thing.

## Parameters

The declared parameter surface. This is what a sweep varies, an optimiser
searches, and a tolerance study draws from.

```json
"parameters": {
  "mirrorDepth": {
    "value": 90.0, "unit": "mm",
    "minimum": 20.0, "maximum": 300.0,
    "description": "Depth of the printed mirror, entrance plane to cap."
  },
  "halfGap":     { "expression": "boardGap / 2", "unit": "mm" },
  "rodRatio":    { "value": 1.1468, "unit": "1" }
}
```

A parameter declares **either** `value` **or** `expression`, never both, and
always a `unit` (`"1"` for a pure ratio). Bounds are optional and given as plain
numbers in the same unit.

Bounds are part of the declaration rather than a separate validation pass because
they carry design intent. A mirror depth that may run 20–300 mm says something a
bare nominal does not, and it is what lets a study be written as "vary everything
over its declared range" instead of restating limits the template already knows.
Bounds are **checked, not clamped**: a sweep that walks a parameter past its
declared range has found something the template author did not intend, and
clamping would hide it.

### Expressions

Arithmetic over other parameters: `+ - * /`, parentheses, unary minus, and
`abs(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, `min(a,b)`, `max(a,b)`.

Expressions evaluate over **quantities, not numbers**, so dimensions propagate
through the arithmetic and the declared unit is checked against the dimension the
expression actually produces. That makes the evaluator a unit checker as much as
a calculator: `boardGap / 2` is a length, and a term adding a length to a voltage
fails where it is written rather than thousands of steps later. `sqrt` is
restricted to dimensionless arguments, because the square root of a length has no
representation in an integer-exponent dimension system and silently dropping the
dimension would defeat the check.

Derived parameters are evaluated in dependency order, and a cycle is refused with
the chain named rather than recursed into. Derived parameters **re-evaluate
against overrides**, which is the property that makes sweeping meaningful:
perturb `capToCap` and everything expressed in terms of it follows.

This is a sandbox in the sense that matters: the grammar is arithmetic, nothing
but a parameter can be named, and evaluation cannot loop. It is not a scripting
language and is not meant to become one — extension goes through Python behind a
process boundary, not through the model format.

## Ion, source, detector

```json
"ion":    { "massToCharge": { "value": 500, "unit": "Da" }, "chargeNumber": 1 },
"source": {
  "position":              { "value": [-100, 0, 0], "unit": "mm" },
  "direction":             { "value": [1, 0, 0] },
  "accelerationPotential": { "value": 4, "unit": "kV" },
  "energyFraction":        0
},
"detector": {
  "planePoint": { "value": [-100, 0, 0], "unit": "mm" },
  "normal":     { "value": [1, 0, 0] }
}
```

The source states an *energy*, never a velocity; the launch speed is derived from
the ion's own mass and charge, so the document cannot state two things that
disagree. `energyFraction` offsets it fractionally for acceptance studies.

The detector normal points back into the flight volume: the flight ends when the
ion crosses from the positive side to the negative side, and the integrator lands
on the crossing exactly rather than at the end of whichever step passed it,
because the crossing time is the measurement.

### The source cloud

Without a `cloud`, a source launches **one ion down the axis**, and every figure
computed from it is a property of that ion rather than of the instrument. That is
why resolving powers here have carried the caveat "energy aberration only".

```json
"source": {
  "position":              { "value": [-100, 0, 0], "unit": "mm" },
  "direction":             { "value": [1, 0, 0] },
  "accelerationPotential": { "value": 4, "unit": "kV" },
  "cloud": {
    "ions": 1000,
    "seed": 1,
    "temperature":          { "value": 300, "unit": "K" },
    "transverseSpread":     { "value": 0.3, "unit": "mm" },
    "longitudinalSpread":   { "value": 0.1, "unit": "mm" },
    "energyFractionSpread": 0.01
  }
}
```

| Field | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `ions` | How many **trajectories to compute**. A numerical setting: sampling harder only makes a statistic better. ACC-5 wants transmission to ±1% at 95%, which needs about 9,600 at the worst point |
| `population` | How many ions are **physically in the packet**, which is what pushes on itself. Defaults to `ions` |
| `seed` | So the same study gives the same answer twice |
| `temperature` | Thermal velocity, drawn per component as a Gaussian of width √(kT/m). This is the whole turn-around story |
| `transverseSpread` | Gaussian width across the direction of travel. Costs transmission |
| `longitudinalSpread` | Gaussian width along it. Costs arrival time directly — two ions a millimetre apart are a millimetre of flight path apart |
| `energyFractionSpread` | Gaussian width of the acceleration energy. Supply ripple, not temperature |

Every spread defaults to zero, so a model that says nothing about a cloud launches
exactly what it launched before. That is not only backward compatibility: a spread
appearing by default would change every existing result silently, and a resolving
power quietly getting worse is indistinguishable from a bug.

**`ions` and `population` are not the same thing.** One is how hard the source
distribution is sampled; the other is how many ions are actually there at once.
Ten thousand samples of a single-ion experiment is a better statistic. Ten thousand
ions in a bunch is a different experiment, because they push each other apart.

The default is the conservative reading — the ions simulated are the ions
present — so a dense packet is never silently treated as sparse. Set
`"population": 1` when sampling an intrinsic source property one ion at a time.

**There is no angular-divergence setting, on purpose.** A thermal cloud already
has one — an ion with sideways thermal velocity is an ion launched at an angle —
and offering both would let a document say two things about the same physics and
be believed twice. Energy spread *is* separate, because supply ripple varies the
energy without varying the direction, which a temperature cannot express.

**A packet may start at rest.** `accelerationPotential` of zero used to be a
validation error - "or the ion never moves" - which is true of a beam and false of
a pulsed extraction trap, where the packet sits still until the instrument
switches a field on. Zero is accepted when the model declares a field that could
accelerate the ion, and still refused when nothing could.

For a packet at rest the `direction` is doing more work than usual. A moving ion
says which way is downstream by moving; a stationary one does not, so the declared
direction is what orients `longitudinalSpread` against `transverseSpread` - and
those are not interchangeable. Spread along the extraction converts to an energy
spread and then to arrival time; spread across it does not.

A declared cloud is what makes the emittance figures available. `transverseSpread`
and `temperature` are the two widths whose product the emittance is, so a cloud
with one and not the other has an emittance of exactly zero — correctly, since
every ion is then parallel — and a cloud with neither has no packet to measure.

## Driving a geometry

```json
"solve": {
  "drive": {
    "frequency": { "value": 1, "unit": "MHz" },
    "waveform": "sinusoid",
    "dutyCycle": 0.5
  },
  "electrodes": [
    { "name": "rodXPlus", ...,
      "potential":      { "value": 0, "unit": "V" },
      "driveAmplitude": { "value": 500, "unit": "V" },
      "drivePhase": 0 },
    { "name": "rodYPlus", ...,
      "potential":      { "value": 0, "unit": "V" },
      "driveAmplitude": { "value": -500, "unit": "V" } }
  ]
}
```

**One generator per solve.** A real instrument has a supply and electrodes tapped
off it at various amplitudes and phases; modelling it the other way round would let
a document declare two frequencies on one structure, which is a different
instrument and almost always a mistake.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `frequency` | On the solve. The one thing every electrode shares |
| `waveform` | `sinusoid` (Mathieu) or `rectangular` (Meissner). Their stability boundaries are in different places: the square-wave cut-off is q = 0.712 against a sinusoid's 0.908 |
| `dutyCycle` | Rectangular only. Away from one half the wave carries a mean of 2d - 1, which enters the equation of motion exactly where a DC offset would - the trick of a digital mass filter |
| `driveAmplitude` | Per electrode, zero to peak, **signed**. A negative amplitude is the same as a half-cycle of phase |
| `drivePhase` | Per electrode, as a fraction of a cycle. Zero when omitted; a half is antiphase; a ramp along a structure is a travelling wave |
| `potential` | Still the DC part, and still what an undriven electrode holds |

An amplitude with no `drive` block is **refused**, naming the electrode. A document
that thinks it declared RF and did not is the expensive kind of silence.

Nothing is re-solved as the drive swings: electrodes sharing a time dependence
share one basis solve, and a quadrupole's two pairs are exact negatives, so four
rods reduce to one. See [Numerics](numerics.md).

### Drive phase is an expression

```json
"drivePhase": { "expression": "-waveDirection * ring / ringsPerWave", "unit": "1" }
```

A fraction of a cycle, dimensionless, and — like every other placement — an
expression rather than a number. It was a plain number until a travelling-wave
guide needed one, which is exactly the case the field existed for: a phase that
cannot depend on the repeat index cannot ramp along a stack.

Two things about it are worth knowing before writing one.

**The drive is evaluated as a phase lead**, `w(f·t + φ)`, so a phase that
*increases* along the axis sends the crest *upstream*. That is a convention, not a
physical fact; the travelling-wave template names a `waveDirection` parameter and
negates it in the ramp rather than leaving a reader to infer it from a minus sign.

**A sinusoidal drive costs two solves however many phases you use.** A cos(2π(ft +
φ)) is a fixed pair of quadrature components with constant coefficients, so the
decomposition resolves every phase into the same two supplies — 96 rings at 96
phases is two basis solves. A rectangular drive cannot be decomposed that way, and
there each distinct phase is its own supply and the solve count says so.

## Three dimensions

```json
{
  "type": "solved3d",
  "solve3d": {
    "minX": ..., "minY": ..., "minZ": ...,
    "maxX": ..., "maxY": ..., "maxZ": ...,
    "cellSize": { "value": 0.8, "unit": "mm" },
    "drive": { "frequency": { "value": 1, "unit": "MHz" } },
    "electrodes": [
      { "name": "rod", "shape": "cylinder", "axis": "z",
        "centreX": ..., "centreY": ..., "radius": ...,
        "lower": ..., "upper": ...,
        "potential": ..., "driveAmplitude": ... }
    ]
  }
}
```

Three primitives: `box` (a plate, a segment wall, a housing), `cylinder` (a rod, a
tube, a ring - along `x`, `y` or `z`), and `sphere` (a bead, a rounded end).
Everything else is as it is for `solved2d`: repeats, drives, stages, sub-cell
boundaries, solid electrodes.

**Three dimensions cost the cube of the resolution.** A cross-section at sixteen
cells across a bore is 128 by 128 nodes; the same in three dimensions is two
million. So a 3D model is meshed far more coarsely than a plane one, and field
quality is the thing to check first rather than to assume - see
[Numerics](numerics.md) for what the solver does and does not manage.

Use it when the geometry genuinely varies along all three axes. A device that is a
cross-section extruded, or a half-plane rotated, is enormously cheaper and more
accurate as `solved2d` with the matching symmetry.

## Operating an instrument through a sequence

The sequencer the architecture calls a timed state machine. A trap fills,
isolates, then extracts, and what the electrodes hold differs in each:

```json
"sequence": [
  { "name": "fill",    "duration": { "value": 200, "unit": "us" } },
  { "name": "isolate", "duration": { "value": 50,  "unit": "us" },
    "set": { "rfAmplitude": { "value": 300, "unit": "V" } } },
  { "name": "extract", "duration": { "value": 10,  "unit": "us" },
    "set": { "rfAmplitude":   { "value": 0, "unit": "V" },
             "pushPotential": { "value": 1000, "unit": "V" } } }
]
```

**The timeline belongs to the instrument**, which is §9's own wording: "an
instrument is a timed state machine: ordered phases with durations, excitation
overrides, transport mode, and transition conditions". It sits on the model, not
inside one field element, because a phase holds across the whole thing.

### A phase sets parameters, not electrode settings

That is the whole design. Electrode potentials are already expressions over
parameters, so setting one moves everything that depends on it at once —
including *derived* parameters. Listing electrode settings instead would let a
phase change an amplitude while leaving the quantity it was derived from behind,
and the two would disagree silently.

It also costs no new vocabulary: the same override mechanism a sweep or an
optimiser uses to *perturb* a design is what a sequence uses to *operate* one.

Anything a phase does not name keeps the value it has outside the sequence.

### Every element follows it, and how depends on what it is

A **solved** geometry follows a phase by re-weighting the channels it has already
solved — the geometry is untouched, so nothing is re-solved. An **analytic**
element has no channels to re-weight, so it is compiled once per phase and
switched. An element whose expressions do not depend on any parameter a phase sets
stays static, which is a distinction rather than an optimisation: wrapping it
would hand the integrator switch instants to land on for a field that is the same
on both sides of them.

It was not always so, twice over, and both are in `docs/lessons.md`. Stages used
to be compiled per element, so two electrodes in different elements written as the
*same expression* over the same parameter came out at 900 V and 300 V during a
phase. And the first fix reached only the solved branch, so an analytic element
stayed frozen at baseline while the solved ones moved.

### The older spelling, and the refusals

`stages` on a solve still works and means the same thing — the shipped
`sequenced-extraction` example is written in it, and a single-element model has no
ambiguity to resolve. Two refusals cover the ways a document can say two things at
once: **two elements each declaring stages** is two timelines over one instrument,
and **declaring both `sequence` and `stages`** is refused rather than merged, the
same argument that refuses a geometry declaring both `drive` and `drives`. An
explicitly empty `"sequence": []` is refused too, since an empty timeline reads
exactly like no timeline.

### Two rules enforced rather than documented

**A phase may change what an electrode holds, not where it is.** Moving metal
between phases would change the mask, so each phase would need its own solve and
its own grid — and the field would still be computed, and it would be wrong in a
way nothing else catches. Refused, naming the electrode and the phase.

**The last phase holds after the sequence ends.** An instrument left alone stays
where it was put. A field that switched off at the end of the declared sequence
would make every ion still in flight suddenly coast, which is a physics change
disguised as a bookkeeping one.

A sequence needs no drive: a pulsed extraction is DC that switches, and a model
with a sequence and no `drive` block is exactly that. `sequenced-uniform` in the
examples corpus is the smallest one — an ion at rest in nothing until a phase
switches a uniform field on, arriving at `hold + sqrt(2 d m / (q E))`.

Schema **0.6** carries `sequence`.

## Repeating an electrode

A stack of rings is one ring, written once:

```json
{
  "name": "ring",
  "shape": "rectangle",
  "repeat": { "count": { "expression": "ringCount" }, "index": "ring" },
  "minX": { "expression": "ring * ringPitch", "unit": "mm" },
  "minY": { "expression": "entranceRadius - ring * taper", "unit": "mm" },
  "potential":      { "expression": "-dcGradient * ring / (ringCount - 1)", "unit": "V" },
  "driveAmplitude": { "expression": "rfAmplitude * (1 - 2 * mod(ring, 2))", "unit": "V" }
}
```

The index runs from zero and is bound as an ordinary parameter, so every expression
on the electrode sees it. The copies are named by position - `ring-0`, `ring-17` -
so an error, a loss itemisation or a channel report says *which* one.

This is the discrete periodicity SYM-1 lists beside cylindrical symmetry and mirror
planes, and it is what keeps a two-hundred-ring stack a **parametric** document
rather than a generated one: the placements are still expressions, so "move every
ring 50 microns and re-solve" is still sayable, which is what the whole tolerance
apparatus rests on.

An index name that collides with a declared parameter is refused rather than
shadowing it.

### Two more functions

`floor(x)` and `mod(a, b)` join `abs`, `sqrt`, `min` and `max`. Indexed geometry
needs them: the alternating sign of a two-phase stack is `1 - 2 * mod(index, 2)`.

Both are dimensionless-only, for the reason `sqrt` is - the floor of a length
depends on which unit you take it in, and that is precisely the ambiguity the
evaluator exists to refuse. `mod` is Euclidean rather than truncated, so
`mod(-1, 2)` is 1: an index counted backwards still alternates the way it should.

`cosPi(x)` and `sinPi(x)` join them, and take **half turns rather than radians**.
A multipole needs them: 2n rods at pi/n intervals is
`rodCentre * cosPi(2 * pole / poleCount)`, and without trigonometry that geometry
cannot be written at all.

Half turns because `Math.Cos(Math.PI / 2)` is 6.1e-17 rather than zero, so a rod
placed at a quarter turn would land a hair off axis and the multipole would carry a
spurious dipole made of rounding. `cosPi(0.5)` is exactly zero. This is the same
convention, for the same reason, that the drive decomposition already uses to keep
an antiphase electrode from picking up a quadrature component of pure round-off.

## What a solve is a cross-section of

```json
"solve": {
  "symmetry": "cylindrical",
  "minY": { "value": 0, "unit": "mm" },
  ...
}
```

`translational` (the default) extrudes the plane along the third axis: a
cross-section, which is what a mass filter or a rectilinear trap is.
`cylindrical` rotates it about the x axis, with **y as the radius**, so the domain
must lie at y >= 0 and a negative `minY` is refused.

This is not presentation. It changes the operator - in cylindrical coordinates the
radial part of the Laplacian gains a term from the shrinking circumference of a
ring near the axis - and a field solved with the wrong one converges perfectly well
to the wrong answer. See [Numerics](numerics.md) for the discretisation and what it
is checked against.

Everything else behaves as before, and that is the point of SYM-1: an electrode is
declared the same way, and a rectangle that was a bar becomes a ring. The ion is
launched and tracked in ordinary three-dimensional space; nothing above the field
knows the solve happened in a half-plane.

The axis is a symmetry plane whatever `bottomEdge` says, and is forced to be one.
Requiring the author to declare it would be an opportunity to get it wrong, and
there is no second thing it could be.

## Placements are expressions, including vectors

Spec section 9: every placement is a parametric expression, never a baked number.
Scalars take `expression` in place of `value`; vectors take three of them, one per
component, because the components are independent.

```json
"detector": {
  "planePoint": { "expression": ["plateOuter + driftLength", "0", "0"], "unit": "mm" },
  "normal": { "value": [-1, 0, 0] }
}
```

When expressions are present the `unit` is not consulted - each expression carries
its own dimension, exactly as a scalar expression does.

**A dimensionless zero satisfies any dimension.** The grammar has no unit literals,
so a bare `0` is dimensionless and there would otherwise be no way to write "on
axis" for the two components that are. This is the one safe exception: zero is the
only value whose unit conversion is the identity, and the ambiguity that makes
units mandatory here - is 4000 volts or kilovolts - does not exist at zero. A
dimensionless *one* is still refused, with the offending component named:

```
UNITS_INCOMPATIBLE
  at         /detector/planePoint/expression/1
  constraint this field requires a vector of dimension m
  observed   1 1
  try        the expression '1' produces dimension 1
```

## Fields

A list, superposed. Superposition is exact for electrostatics.

```json
{ "type": "fieldFree" }

{ "type": "uniform",
  "field": { "value": [0, -80000, 0], "unit": "V/m" } }

{ "type": "halfSpaceUniform",
  "planePoint":   { "value": [0, 0, 0], "unit": "mm" },
  "inwardNormal": { "value": [1, 0, 0] },
  "capPotential": { "value": 4, "unit": "kV" },
  "turningDepth": { "value": 50, "unit": "mm" } }
```

`halfSpaceUniform` is field-free on one side of a plane and uniformly retarding on
the other — the primitive an ideal single-stage ion mirror is built from. It is
named for what it is rather than what it builds, because no device class may
appear below the template library.

```json
{ "type": "idealQuadrupoleRf",
  "directPotential":  { "value": 0,   "unit": "V" },
  "driveAmplitude":   { "value": 200, "unit": "V" },
  "driveFrequency":   { "value": 1,   "unit": "MHz" },
  "inscribedRadius":  { "value": 4,   "unit": "mm" } }
```

`idealQuadrupoleRf` is **the only analytic driven field**, and it exists for the
reason the analytic tier exists at all: something exact to check a solved geometry
against. Every other driven field here is solved, so an expectation written from
the ideal formula against solved rods would be asserting a few per cent of
modelling difference as though it were arithmetic — which is what blocked the
driven diffusive corpus examples until this existed.

The x pair takes `directPotential` and `driveAmplitude`; the y pair takes their
negatives, which is what makes the field a quadrupole rather than a quadrupole plus
an offset. **A zero frequency is refused** — that is a static field wearing a
drive's clothes, and it would run quietly and give a quadrupole with no RF. A zero
*amplitude* is allowed and is the honest way to say the generator is off.

Note the field amplitude convention when writing closed forms against it:
`E0(r) = 2 V r / r0^2`, because the potential is `V(x^2 - y^2)/r0^2` and its
gradient carries the factor of two. Dropping it makes a pseudopotential exactly
four times too small.

### Solved fields

```json
{ "type": "solved2d",
  "solve": {
    "minX": { "expression": "-mirrorDepth", "unit": "mm" },
    "minY": { "expression": "-halfGap",     "unit": "mm" },
    "maxX": { "expression": "midPlane",     "unit": "mm" },
    "maxY": { "expression": "halfGap",      "unit": "mm" },
    "cellSize": { "expression": "boardGap / 32", "unit": "mm" },
    "rightEdge": "neumann",
    "boundaryIsDiscontinuous": false,
    "reflectAboutX": { "expression": "midPlane", "unit": "mm" },
    "electrodes": [ ]
  } }
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `minX`…`maxY` | The solve domain |
| `cellSize` | Requested node spacing. Each axis rounds its interval count **up** to a power of two independently, so the spacing is never coarser than asked in either direction and the grid spans exactly the declared box. Cells need not be square; the worst ratio is two to one |
| `leftEdge`, `rightEdge`, `bottomEdge`, `topEdge` | `dirichlet` (default) or `neumann`, a symmetry plane |
| `boundaryIsDiscontinuous` | Whether the field genuinely jumps at the domain edge. **Set false when the domain was drawn wide enough that the field has decayed** — see below |
| `reflectAboutX` | Reflect the solved field through a plane and superpose, for a symmetric pair |
| `tolerance` | Relative residual for the solve, default 1e-12 |

`boundaryIsDiscontinuous` is worth understanding before setting it. Declaring a
jump that is not there is worse than declaring none: two such phantom surfaces a
few microns apart — which is what two abutting solve domains produce — defeat the
superposition's sign tracking, so a step crossing both is treated as crossing
neither. That cost an ion 2.6e-4 of its energy, four orders above the ACC-4
budget, and presented as an intermittent transmission loss rather than a fault.

### Electrodes

Three primitives, chosen for coverage rather than convenience.

```json
{ "name": "plate", "shape": "rectangle",
  "minX": …, "minY": …, "maxX": …, "maxY": …,
  "potential": { "value": 0, "unit": "V" } }

{ "name": "rodXPlus", "shape": "disc",
  "centreX": …, "centreY": …, "radius": …,
  "potential": { "expression": "rodPotential", "unit": "V" } }

{ "name": "topBoard", "shape": "edgeProfile", "edge": "top",
  "profile": [
    { "at": …, "potential": … },
    { "at": …, "potential": … }
  ] }
```

A **rectangle** gives plates, apertures, and any stripe of a printed board. A
**disc** is a rod in cross-section, which is what a quadrupole, hexapole, or
octopole is. An **edge profile** is a domain edge whose potential varies along it
by piecewise-linear interpolation, which is how a printed-circuit mirror applies
its ramp — one electrode spanning many nodes, because that is how it is driven:
one supply feeding a resistive divider.

The test of whether these are the right primitives is LIB-1's: if a new device
needs a change below the template library, either it is genuinely novel physics
or the abstraction is wrong, and almost always the second. A mirror and a
quadrupole differ only in which primitives they use and where they put them.

## Transport

```json
"transport": {
  "mode": "trajectory",
  "relativeTolerance": 1e-11,
  "maximumFlightTime": { "value": 1, "unit": "ms" },
  "sampleInterval":    { "value": 20, "unit": "ns" }
}
```

`maximumFlightTime` is **required**, as a runaway guard. `sampleInterval` sets the
cadence of the trajectory stream written for rendering and export, which is
independent of integration steps — though only in one direction: the stream can
be coarser than the steps, never finer, because there is no dense output to
interpolate within a step.

`statisticalDiffusion` is a declared peer mode that this build does not implement.
Asking for it is a regime violation with a distinct exit code, not a silent
substitution.

### How the density is stepped

```json
"transport": {
  "mode": "diffusion",
  "densityStep": { "scheme": "implicit", "gain": 64 }
}
```

`explicit`, the default, is forward Euler, bounded by the faster of two limits:
diffusion, and the Courant condition on how fast the drift crosses a cell. `implicit`
is backward Euler, which has **no stability limit** and charges Gauss-Seidel sweeps
instead. `gain` is how many times the explicit stability limit to step, and is refused
against the explicit scheme rather than ignored — that scheme cannot take a longer step,
and honouring half a block would leave an author concluding the solver is slow rather
than that the request went nowhere.

**Which to use is a property of the model, which is why it is in the document.** The
Gauss-Seidel iteration's difficulty is set by the *diffusive* part of the operator, so a
step long by Courant's standard but still short by diffusion's converges in about three
sweeps — while a problem already at its diffusion limit needs tens and comes out slower
than stepping explicitly.

The driven case is what this is for. A ponderomotive well's gradient is steepest at an
electrode edge, which is exactly where the density is almost zero, so the explicit step
is set by a region where nothing is happening: on the shipped ion funnel at 2 mbar,
195 ps against a diffusion limit of 747 ns.

| gain | steps | sweeps/step | speedup | error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 6,404 | 3.0 | 1.4× | 0.008% |
| 16 | 1,601 | 3.0 | 4.7× | 0.028% |
| 64 | 401 | 3.0 | **10.8×** | **0.108%** |
| 256 | 101 | 4.0 | 17.7× | 0.427% |
| 1024 | 26 | 4.9 | 21.4× | 1.673% |

**Backward Euler is first order, so the error is linear in the gain** — which is what
the table shows, and there is no default above one because what gain is acceptable is an
accuracy question and nothing here measures the accuracy of a step it has not taken. A
run reports the step it took, the sweeps it took per step, and the fraction of the
explicit work it did, whether or not any of those crosses a threshold; and
`diffusion.implicit-not-paying` says so when the sweeps cost more than the step saved.

**Positivity survives a partial solve**, which is what makes the scheme usable at all:
every term in the Gauss-Seidel update is non-negative, so the iterate is a valid density
however far from converged it is. What an unconverged solve costs is *conservation*, and
`diffusion.implicit-unconverged` reports the residual the ledger is closed to.

### Space charge

```json
"transport": {
  "spaceCharge": "direct"
}
```

`none`, the default, flies each ion through a field that does not know the others
exist. That is exactly right for a sparse beam and wrong for a dense packet, and
a run says which it is either way — the screening estimate is reported whether or
not it crosses a threshold.

`direct` sums every pair. It is the reference method SC-1 names, and it is a
string rather than a flag because there is a third value and a boolean would have
had to be replaced rather than extended.

`pic` deposits the packet's charge onto its own grid, solves Poisson once, and
gathers the field back. It costs one solve plus O(N) rather than O(N²) — but the
solve is paid for whatever the cloud, so **the crossing is near 850 trajectories**
and below that the reference method is simply faster.

```json
"transport": {
  "spaceCharge": "pic",
  "spaceChargeGrid": { "nodes": 32, "padding": 4.0, "refreshTolerance": 0.05 }
}
```

Every field is optional and every default is shown. A `spaceChargeGrid` declared
against any other method is **refused rather than ignored**, the same rule an
unrecognised property follows: a document that configures a solve it is not
running has been misunderstood by its author.

**`nodes` has an optimum rather than a floor**, and it is the one thing to know
before turning it. The grid smooths the mutual force at the scale of one cell, so
too coarse under-pushes and too fine stops representing a density at all —
measured against the direct sum taken to its own point limit at **−15.1%, −4.2%,
+0.08% and +4.4%** for cells of 3.68, 1.84, 0.92 and 0.46 mean macroparticle
spacings. Raising it past the match buys a worse answer *and* a cubic cost, so
`spacecharge.grid-resolution` reports the ratio on every run whether or not it
crosses a threshold, and names the node count that would match.

`padding` sets the box half-width in packet RMS radii. A packet in flight is in
free space and this puts it in an earthed box; centring the box on the packet is
what makes that cheap, since a centred distribution induces almost no field at its
own centre.

`refreshTolerance` is the fractional change in RMS radius that forces a new solve.
The grid travels with the packet, so uniform translation is **exact** (1e-11 across
250 mm) and free — which is why the criterion is written on shape rather than on a
step count, shape being the only thing that ages. Tightening it converges:
**+12.68%, +6.16%, +1.01%, −0.54%** at 0.30, 0.15, 0.05 and 0.02, always wide at
the coarse end because a field held across a refresh is the field of a *denser*
packet than the one being pushed.

**The weighting is the cloud's own two fields.** `ions` is how many trajectories
are computed; `population` is how many ions are physically present. Each computed
trajectory therefore stands in for `population / ions` real ions and carries their
charge *and* their mass together — so charge-to-mass is unchanged, motion in the
applied field is bit-identical to the unweighted case, and only the pairwise sum
notices. Lowering `ions` while keeping `population` is how a dense packet becomes
affordable, and it is a declared approximation rather than a hidden one.

**The direct sum's cost is quadratic in `ions`**, and `einzel estimate` says so in
words as well as in a number, because the linear intuition is exactly wrong: 150
trajectories through the shipped trap took 87 seconds and 2,000 would take about
four hours. **The grid's is linear in `ions` and cubic in `nodes`** — 200
macroparticles take 0.99 s at 16 nodes and 124 s at 128 — so the estimate costs
both in the same currency and states their ratio *at this cloud* rather than the
asymptotics. Quoting the asymptotics alone would recommend the approximation
everywhere, including the majority of clouds where it loses to the method it
approximates. Trajectory integration is otherwise excluded from the estimate — its
cost depends on a path that depends on a field not yet solved — so this is the one
transport cost stated in advance.

Three ways to ask for it and not get it are **refused rather than run**, because
each would produce a result that looks like the one asked for:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Fewer than two trajectories | nobody to push on |
| A cloud with no spatial spread | an unbounded self-field, not a large one |
| A declared gas | either method advances the packet in lockstep and has no collision hook, so the gas would take no part in the run |

What it gives up, stated rather than discovered: the packet integrator **cannot
land exactly on a declared field discontinuity**, because a shared step cannot land
on a surface each macroparticle reaches at its own instant. It caps the step short
of the first arrival instead. That is why this is the reference method for space
charge rather than a replacement for the path that carries ACC-1.

## Bounding an analytic element, so two instruments can share a document

An analytic field has no extent, **because a formula does not**. That is harmless while
such a field is an idealisation of a whole instrument — a uniform field, a retarding
half-space — and stops being harmless the moment one is an exact statement of a real device
sitting *next to* another. A quadro-logarithmic potential grows as `z^2`, so an orbital
analyser declared beside the trap that injects it puts an enormous field across that trap.

Superposition is exact and the sequencer can express a handover, so nothing else about
composing two devices was ever in doubt. **And the obvious escape does not exist:**
declaring the analyser as solved geometry, so its own domain bounds it, fails because its
electrodes are equipotentials of the field they produce — the profile satisfies
`-r^2/2 + Rm^2 ln(r/Rm) = A - z^2`, transcendental in `r` and invertible only through
Lambert W — and the 2-D shape vocabulary is rectangle, disc and edge profile, none of which
is a curve a document can name.

So an analytic element may declare a **region**: a box outside which it contributes nothing.

```json
{
  "type": "quadroLogarithmic",
  "curvature": { "value": 20, "unit": "V/mm^2" },
  "characteristicRadius": { "value": 20, "unit": "mm" },
  "region": {
    "minX": { "value": -30, "unit": "mm" }, "maxX": { "value": 30, "unit": "mm" },
    "minY": { "value": -30, "unit": "mm" }, "maxY": { "value": 30, "unit": "mm" },
    "minZ": { "value": -30, "unit": "mm" }, "maxZ": { "value": 30, "unit": "mm" }
  }
}
```

Measured on a two-element document — an orbital analyser at the origin and an ordinary
1 kV/m accelerating section 75 mm downstream:

| in the second device | field along x |
| --- | --- |
| analyser unbounded | **−1,499,000 V/m** |
| analyser bounded | **1,000.0 V/m**, exactly its own |

**And on the axis it is worse than swamping.** Without a region the second device has a
line through it at which the model cannot be asked a question at all, because that line is
the analyser's singular axis and a quadro-logarithmic field refuses a point there rather
than returning a large one.

Inside the region nothing changes — asserted to the bit against the same field built alone,
which is the control that makes the rest mean anything. All six bounds are required: a
half-open region is a legitimate thing to want, but "the axes I left out" is not how anyone
reads a partly-filled box. A **solved** element may not declare one, refused rather than
ignored, because a solve is already bounded by its own domain and a document that says a
thing twice can say it two ways. A region with no extent is refused too.

### The boundary is a step, and the step costs less than it looks like it should

**A box is not an equipotential of anything interesting**, so the potential does not match
across a region boundary. The first version of this write-up concluded from that that an ion
crossing gains or loses the potential it left. **It does not**, and measuring it is what
settled it.

An ion is moved by the **field**, and the field is exactly the declared one on each side. So
a uniform field bounded to a box is an accelerating gap followed by a field-free drift —
which is an ordinary instrument with a closed form:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `sqrt(2 m L / (q E)) + (D - L) / v` | **13.658582 us** |
| measured, bounded | **13.658582 us** |
| the same model with no region | 10.180506 us, accelerating the whole way |

The control matters as much as the agreement: without the region the field reaches the
detector and the flight is a third shorter, so a region that silently did nothing would not
pass.

**What the step does cost**, stated rather than overstated:

- the **energy-drift diagnostic** jumps at the boundary, because that is computed from the
  potential;
- and the piecewise field is **not conservative across the boundary**, so an ion that
  crosses more than once — in by one face and out by another — can gain or lose energy no
  electrode supplied. A single straight crossing has no such path.

Every bounded element reports the largest potential on its boundary in volts and as a
fraction of what the ion is accelerated through, whether or not it crosses a threshold
(REG-2), at severity `Qualified`: the result is usable, and here is the thing about it worth
knowing.

The field discontinuity itself needs no apology. The boundary is presented as a signed
distance whose zero the integrator brackets and lands on exactly — the same first-class
event a declared discontinuity already is (§11).

**`FieldAssembly.Build`'s contract narrowed when regions arrived**, and the line it draws is
about *who knows the thing* rather than about how bad it is. It used to refuse a field
carrying any warning. An unconverged solve is evidence only the engine has: nothing in the
document says the residual missed, the field looks identical either way, and a bare field
has no envelope to carry it on — so refusing is the only honest option, and this project has
lost numbers at exactly that seam. A region's step is a consequence of geometry the author
wrote down and can see. Refusing every one would make `Build` unusable for the composed
beamlines a region exists to enable, in exchange for repeating what the document already
says.

### The limitation, and the better design it points at

The step is still large for the fields one most wants to bound — a uniform potential never
decays (100 V at 50 mm from its own zero) and a quadro-logarithmic one *grows* (7,000 V at
30 mm) — so "place the boundary where the field has decayed" has nowhere to point for
either. That is tolerable for a beam passing through, and it is not what a real device does.

A real device's field is bounded by a **conductor**, and a conductor is an equipotential —
of the very field it produces. Bounding an analytic element by one of its own level sets
rather than by a box would make the potential continuous *by construction*, offset so it is
zero outside, with the field discontinuous exactly as `halfSpaceUniform` already is and the
geometry exactly a real electrode. That is the next refinement, and it is not what was built
here.

## Versioning

Schema 0.1 through 0.5 all load. Every bump ships a migration and a test that the
prior corpus still loads. Codes and field names are a compatibility surface that
agent workflows bind to: they are added, never reworded or repurposed.

0.3 adds the source cloud and 0.5 the mutual Coulomb force. Both purely additive,
so every earlier document still reads — but a document whose ions push on each
other genuinely is not a 0.4 document, and saying so is cheaper than an older
build reading it, ignoring the field it does not know, and reporting a different
flight with nothing to indicate that anything was dropped.

## Several generators on one geometry

A `solve` may declare `drives` instead of `drive`, and each electrode names which ones
it taps and with what amplitude and phase:

```json
"drives": [
  { "name": "wave",    "frequency": { "value": 0.5, "unit": "MHz" } },
  { "name": "confine", "frequency": { "value": 3.0, "unit": "MHz" } }
],
"electrodes": [
  {
    "name": "ring",
    "repeat": { "count": { "expression": "ringCount" }, "index": "ring" },
    "potential": { "value": 0, "unit": "V" },
    "taps": [
      { "drive": "wave",
        "amplitude": { "expression": "rfAmplitude", "unit": "V" },
        "phase": { "expression": "-waveDirection * ring / ringsPerWave", "unit": "1" } },
      { "drive": "confine",
        "amplitude": { "expression": "confineAmplitude", "unit": "V" },
        "phase": { "expression": "mod(ring, 2) / 2", "unit": "1" } }
    ]
  }
]
```

`drive` and `driveAmplitude`/`drivePhase` remain the short form for the common case of
one generator, and declaring both spellings is **refused** rather than merged: a
document that says a geometry has one drive and also says it has three is not a
document with a default to fall back on. Every generator needs a `name` once there is
more than one, since a tap resolves by name; duplicates and unknown names are refused,
and the error lists the generators that exist.

**Why the format said "one" and what changed its mind.** The original note in
`CompiledDrive` read: *"one drive per solve ... modelling it the other way round would
let a document declare two frequencies on one structure — which is a different
instrument and almost always a mistake."* Two devices refuted it. A real
travelling-wave guide superposes a fast confining RF on a slow travelling wave, and a
trap performing a stored-waveform isolation runs a low-frequency notched comb across
its endcaps while the ring carries the main drive. **Two frequencies on one structure
is not a mistake; it is what a trap is.**

### It costs nothing in the solver

Basis superposition is indifferent to what the weights are functions of. Two
generators reaching the same electrodes in the same proportions are **one solved
pattern carrying two weights on two clocks**, exactly as a DC supply and an RF supply
already were. What multiplies the solve count is a different *spatial pattern*, never
a different frequency.

Measured on the shipped travelling-wave guide, whose 24 rings each tap both
generators: **3 basis solves**. Two for the wave — a sinusoidal phase ramp collapses
into a fixed quadrature pair however many rings there are — and one for the
alternating confinement.

The quadrature collapse is decided **per generator**, because an instrument may run a
sinusoidal confinement and a switched excitation at once and each collapses or does
not on its own terms.

### It does change the step control

A field with two timescales must cap its step by the faster one.
`DrivenSolvedField.ShortestPeriodSeconds` is the minimum over generators, and for a
harmonic waveform it is the period of the **highest term** rather than of the
fundamental — a comb reaching order 120 carries information a hundred and twenty times
faster than its own repeat rate, and a controller told only the fundamental would step
over every one of those oscillations while its error estimator agreed the step was
accurate. For the field the step was shown. It was not shown the field.

Measured: the guide's wave repeats at 0.5 MHz and its confinement at 3 MHz, and the
assembled field reports **333.33 ns** — the confinement's period, not the wave's.

### What is still one drive

**Three-dimensional solves.** `CompiledSolvedField3D` and `Geometry3D` carry a list
and the builder uses it, so nothing below the document is limited; the `solved3d`
document form has not been given the `drives` spelling. It is the same change and it
has not been needed yet.

**Analytic elements.** An `OscillatingUniformField` is its own generator with its own
frequency, superposed through `DrivenSuperposedField`, which is how the notch-width
measurement in `docs/validation.md` is done. A solved geometry with a supplementary
uniform excitation would be that superposition, and nothing in the format declares
one.

### And on a volume geometry

A `solve3d` takes the same two forms. That was one-sided until recently:
`CompiledSolvedField3D`, `Geometry3D` and the three-dimensional builder all carried a
list of drives from the start, while the document spelled a single `drive` - so a volume
geometry could not express what a cross-section already could.

**The validation is shared rather than copied.** Both electrode documents implement one
`ITappedElectrode` interface and the tap compilation is one function, so the refusals
above - `drive` with `drives`, `driveAmplitude` with `taps` - arrived in three dimensions
by *being* the same code. That was chosen against duplication deliberately: a computation
copied across a seam is how a declared gas came to take part in a run and not in a figure
of merit.

Measured on a volume geometry: two generators reaching the same electrodes in the same
proportions collapse to **one** basis solve carrying two weights on two clocks, and two
distinct spatial patterns give **two**.
