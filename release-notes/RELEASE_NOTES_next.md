# Einzel v26.2.0 release notes

Draft. Append as things land; this file is renamed at release time, so a planned patch can
become a feature release without being renamed twice.

## What is new

- **`compact-astral-3d`**: the published Astral analyzer at one fifth of its size, as a whole
  three-dimensional instrument - both converging mirrors, the foil, the drift and its reversal.
  Every published length is kept beside one `scale` parameter that multiplies it, so it is
  exactly similar to `astral-3d` rather than approximately: its flight time is the full-size
  one times the scale to 1.6e-8. `planar-mirror-pair` and `astral-mirror` are now described as
  the cross-section studies they are.
- **A warning when a solve's mesh samples a face two conductors share** (`mesh.node-on-shared-face`).
  Conductors at different potentials may share a face, but if a mesh node, or the point where a
  stencil arm first meets metal, lies exactly on it, which potential it takes is decided by
  rounding - and no refinement study can see it, because every power-of-two mesh keeps the face
  on a node. The warning names the count, one example and the fix (move the solve domain a tenth
  of a cell), and reaches `einzel run`, `einzel preview`, every figure and `einzel solve`. No
  shipped template or example puts a node on a face two of its electrodes share.
- **The same warning when a conductor meets a grounded face of the domain.** A grounded face is a
  conductor at zero volts, and a node on it that lies on another conductor's surface holds that
  conductor's potential or zero according to rounding: the solve does not see it, but the field
  within about a cell of the contact moves by a fifth of the applied potential, and a conductor
  lying outside the domain against the face is in the solve only by the coin. **Seventeen shipped
  models now carry it** - ring stacks run out to the outer wall, the einzel lens, the Paul trap,
  the Kingdon trap and the two mirror cross-sections - and their figures are marked qualified.
  Fifteen are measured harmless: every figure is identical either side of the coin. In the two
  mirrors, `planar-mirror-pair` and `astral-mirror`, the end cap is a plate with no thickness
  lying in the grounded edge and is in the solve only because two expressions agree exactly; the
  shipped arithmetic lands on the side with a cap.
- **`einzel solve` reports warnings**, in `--json` and on stderr. It reported residuals and node
  counts and nothing else.
- **`einzel render still`** draws a model's shaded 3D view to a PNG, headlessly - the same
  picture the interactive viewport shows, from the same composition and camera. Named views
  (`--view iso|side|top|front`), pixel sizes (`--width-px`, `--height-px`), `--see-through`.
  The PNG carries the engine version, the model's hash and every warning in its text chunks,
  and a validity violation hatches the bottom of the picture.

## Fixed

- **`astral-3d`'s flight time depended on rounding.** Three faces shared by foil slices at
  different voltages lay exactly on planes of mesh nodes, so which voltage the stencil arms in
  those planes took was decided by the last bit of arithmetic - worth 0.27 percent. The foil
  mesh now sits a tenth of a cell off every such face (`meshShiftZ`). The shipped flight time is
  784.90 us (was 786.44) and the drift reversal 336.06 mm (was 336.15). Moving the mesh also
  showed that the foil's coarse mesh carries a 0.83 percent spread by placement alone; the
  mesh-converged flight time is about 775 us, a percent below the published arithmetic rather
  than the 0.4 previously quoted.
- **Printed mirror boards are drawn in the viewport.** The planar mirror pair and the Astral
  mirror were drawn as their end caps alone, because a board declared on a domain edge has no
  interior for the surface extraction to find.
- **A reflected solve is drawn whole.** A mirror pair declared as one half and reflected was
  drawn with one mirror.
- **A zero-width electrode is lit.** Its surface had no normals, so neither viewport could shade it.
- **The cross-platform viewport fits the instrument to the frame.** A long, thin analyzer was
  drawn across the middle third of the picture.
- **`pnnl-ion-funnel` runs again.** Its density grid ended half a millimeter past its detector,
  which the diffusive mode refuses; the grid now ends at the detector by expression.
- **`einzel solve` printed a volume as a plane.** The terminal output gave only the first two
  node counts and spacings, so a 257x17x257 solve read as 257x17 with no z spacing. It now
  prints every axis. `--json` was always correct.
- **`einzel solve` printed a driven element's channels as identical blocks.** A driven
  structure is one solve per basis channel, and each was labeled only `field 0`, so the RF
  funnel's two channels looked like one solve printed twice. Each is now labeled
  `field 0 channel 0`, `field 0 channel 1`, matching the `channel` field in `--json`.

## Known limits

Carried forward from v26.1.0 until they change:

- **The Windows shell is partial**: seven of the eleven views in the specification exist.
- **A still cannot check the window's own GPU path**, and it does not draw the name of a
  validity violation as text: the codes are in the file's text chunks and on stderr.
- **No installer and no updater.** The assets are portable: unpack and run.
- **The extension sandbox states what it does not enforce** — no network confinement, no
  filesystem confinement, no memory ceiling — on every listing and on every result.
