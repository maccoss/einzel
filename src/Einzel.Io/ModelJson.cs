/// AGT-1 requires the model to be declarative, schema-validated, diffable JSON.
/// The serialiser settings here serve the "diffable" half: indented output,
/// camel-case names, and property order fixed by declaration order, so that two
/// models differing in one parameter differ in one line.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Deserialisation failures are translated into AGT-3 error objects. A raw
/// <see cref="JsonException"/> names a .NET type and a byte offset, which is
/// useless to an agent; the translated form names a JSON Pointer and says what
/// was expected.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>An unrecognised property is an error, not something to ignore.</strong>
/// This is the same rule as requiring a unit on every quantity, applied to the key
/// instead of the value, and for the same reason: section 5's whole argument is
/// that an agent building from prose is the actor most likely to introduce a
/// mistake, and a misspelled field name that is silently dropped is the purest
/// form of the section 22 headline risk. The model validates, solves, runs, and
/// answers a different question from the one the document appears to ask.

/// It was found by writing the example corpus. A cloud declaring
/// <c>transverseWidth</c> instead of <c>transverseSpread</c> parsed cleanly, gave
/// a packet with no spatial extent, and produced an emittance of 7.1e-8 um where
/// the closed form says 1.798 - a plausible number, from a model that read as
