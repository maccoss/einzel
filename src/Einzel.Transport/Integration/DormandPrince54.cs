/// <para>
/// Spec section 11 makes adaptive-step Runge-Kutta with per-step error control
/// the default integrator. Dormand-Prince 5(4) is the standard choice: seven
/// stages, a fifth-order solution with an embedded fourth-order estimate for
/// error control, and first-same-as-last, so an accepted step costs six field
/// evaluations rather than seven.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A note on where this sits in the error budget. Spec section 8 is explicit that
/// the instinct to reach for a higher-order integrator is "usually the wrong
/// lever", because in a solved field the dominant error is the interpolant's
/// discontinuous derivatives at cell boundaries, not the integrator's truncation.
/// Stage 1 has no interpolant, which is exactly why the integrator can be
/// characterised honestly here: whatever error shows up against a closed form is
/// the integrator's own.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// All coefficients are written as exact rational quotients rather than decimal
/// literals, so the compiler rounds each once, correctly, instead of inheriting
/// whatever a transcription rounded to.
