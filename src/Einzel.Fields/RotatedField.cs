/// Built for the converging mirrors of an asymmetric-track analyser, and it is a
/// correctness fix rather than a convenience. Declaring the tilt on the electrodes and
/// solving the tilted geometry in three dimensions does not work at any affordable mesh:
/// the whole signal is the field anisotropy <c>Ez/Ex = tan(alpha)</c>, which for a
/// 200 micron convergence over 350 mm is 2.9e-4, while a second-order solve on a
/// 2.5 mm cell across a 40 mm gap carries around 0.4% of field error - fourteen times the
/// signal. Measured against the closed form below, that route gave 3.54, 0.011 and -0.57
/// of the true deceleration depending only on how wide the gaps between mirror strips
/// were.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A rotation is the exact answer instead of an approximated one, because rotations
/// commute with the Laplacian: if the inner field solves Laplace's equation for some
/// geometry, this field solves it exactly for the rotated geometry. Nothing is
/// linearised in the angle, and <c>Ez</c> is <i>constructed</i> from the geometry rather
/// than resolved by differencing a solved field. A shear would have been the obvious
/// spelling and is not equivalent - Laplace is not shear-invariant, and a shear of a
/// mirror pair translates both mirrors the same way, which is no convergence at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The natural partner is a two-dimensional cross-section, which is invariant along z and
/// so can be rotated with no domain to fall out of. A converging pair is then two
/// elements rotated oppositely, each carrying one mirror at potential with the other
/// grounded - which is the ordinary basis decomposition
/// <c>phi = sum_k V_k psi_k</c> and therefore exact, not an approximation.
