/// Two steps, and the order matters. First every electrode's potential is split
/// into the supplies feeding it: a constant one, and one per distinct (drive,
/// phase) pair. A funnel's two hundred rings reach three supplies - a DC chain and
/// two RF phases - however many distinct voltages the chain holds, because what
/// makes a supply one supply is that every electrode on it moves <em>together</em>,
/// not that they move to the same place.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Then supplies are grouped by their <em>spatial pattern</em> rather than by their
/// time dependence. A quadrupole run with DC has two supplies - a steady one and an
/// oscillating one - but both put the x pair up and the y pair down by the same
/// relative amounts, so they are the same solved field with two weights, and the
/// whole filter is one solve.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>A sinusoid is a special case, and it is the one that makes a travelling wave
/// affordable.</b> A cos(2 pi (f t - phi)) is exactly
/// A cos(2 pi phi) cos(2 pi f t) + A sin(2 pi phi) sin(2 pi f t) — a fixed pair of
/// time functions with constant coefficients. So however many distinct phases a
/// structure carries, a sinusoidal drive reaches exactly <em>two</em> supplies. A
/// sixty-ring travelling-wave guide with sixty distinct phases is two solves, not
/// sixty.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It holds only for a sinusoid. A rectangular wave shifted by a quarter cycle is
/// not a combination of the unshifted wave and one shifted by a quarter, so there
/// each distinct phase really is its own supply and the solve count says so. That
/// is why the quadrature flag is <em>per drive</em>: an instrument may run a
/// sinusoidal confinement and a switched excitation at once, and each collapses or
/// does not on its own terms.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Several drives cost no more than one where the geometry allows.</b> Two
