/// <summary>
/// A uniform field whose magnitude follows a waveform: the supplementary dipole
/// excitation a trap uses to eject an ion resonantly.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The other half of what a trap does. The main RF confines every ion in the mass
/// range at once; a small AC voltage applied <em>across</em> a pair of electrodes
/// adds a spatially uniform field that pushes the whole cloud one way and then the
/// other. An ion whose secular frequency matches a component of that excitation
/// absorbs energy from it and grows until it hits something; an ion whose frequency
/// is not in the excitation does not. That is resonant ejection, and with a notched
/// broadband excitation it is isolation — spec section 12's Class B figure,
/// isolation efficiency against notch width.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Uniform is the right idealisation and not a shortcut.</strong> A dipolar
/// excitation across two electrodes produces, near the axis, a field that is
/// constant to first order — that is what makes it a <em>dipole</em> rather than a
/// second quadrupole. Modelling it as uniform is therefore the leading term of the
/// real thing rather than a different thing, and a solved geometry supplies the
/// corrections when one is available.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The frequency is declared independently of any main drive, because a
/// supplementary excitation is a separate supply at a separate frequency; that is
/// the whole point of it. Superposing this with a driven quadrupole gives a field
/// with two timescales, which
/// <see cref="DrivenSuperposedField.ShortestPeriodSeconds"/> resolves by taking the
/// faster.
