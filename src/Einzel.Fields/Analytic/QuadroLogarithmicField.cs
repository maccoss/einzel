/// The quadro-logarithmic field: a harmonic axial well superposed on a logarithmic

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <c>U(r, z) = (k/2)(z^2 - r^2/2) + (k/2) Rm^2 ln(r/Rm)</c>, which satisfies Laplace
/// exactly — the quadratic part contributes <c>-k</c> to the radial Laplacian and <c>+k</c>
/// to the axial one, and the logarithm is harmonic on its own, so the whole thing sums to
/// zero at every point off the axis.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Named for its mathematics rather than for the instrument built from it</b>, following
/// <see cref="HalfSpaceUniformField"/> and for the same reason: architecture invariant 2
/// keeps device names above <c>Einzel.Library</c>. An orbital trap is an arrangement of
/// this field, not something the engine knows about.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The property the field exists for is that the axial motion is exactly harmonic and
/// exactly decoupled.</b> <c>dU/dz = k z</c> with no <c>r</c> in it, so an ion oscillates
/// axially at <c>omega = sqrt(q k / m)</c> whatever its radius, whatever its angular
/// momentum, and whatever its axial amplitude. That independence is not an approximation
/// and is the whole basis of measuring mass by frequency: everything else about the ion's
/// motion can vary and the frequency does not.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The radial field vanishes at Rm</b> and points inward inside it, so bound orbits live
/// at <c>r &lt; Rm</c>. Outside it an ion is pushed away, which is not a defect of the
/// formula but the reason a real trap has an outer electrode there.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The axis is a singularity</b>, as it must be: a logarithm has no value at zero and a
/// field that pulls inward at every radius has to come from somewhere. Physically the
/// central electrode occupies that region. Sampling on the axis is refused rather than
/// clamped, because a clamped value would be a number with no physics behind it and would
/// let an ion be launched somewhere it cannot be.
