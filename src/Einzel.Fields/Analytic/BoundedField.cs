/// <para>
/// <b>An analytic field has no extent, because a formula does not.</b> That is harmless
/// while such a field is an idealisation of a whole instrument — a uniform field, a
/// retarding half-space — and stops being harmless the moment one is an exact statement of
/// a real device sitting <i>next to</i> another. A quadro-logarithmic potential grows as z
/// squared, so an orbital analyser declared beside the trap that injects it puts an
/// enormous field across that trap, and the two instruments cannot be composed even though
/// superposition is exact and the sequencer can express the handover.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The boundary is a field discontinuity, and the potential does not generally match
/// across it.</b> A box is not an equipotential of anything interesting, so an ion crossing
/// one gains or loses the potential it left. That is not hidden: the assembly measures the
/// largest potential anywhere on the boundary and reports it as a non-suppressible
/// violation, in volts, because it is exactly the energy error per crossing. Placing the
/// box where the field has decayed is what makes it small, and a region is a statement
/// about where an idealisation applies rather than a conductor.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Wrapping rather than teaching every analytic field about bounds — the precedent
/// <c>AxisymmetricField</c> and <c>PonderomotiveField</c> set, and for the
/// reason this project has recorded twice: the transport core carries every validated
/// number here, and refactoring it to add a case beside one is how those get quietly lost.
