/// Phi(x, y, t) = (U + V cos(omega t)) (x^2 - y^2) / r0^2, the hyperbolic field a
/// real quadrupole approximates with round rods. Exactly quadrupolar by
/// construction, which is the point: it separates whether the RF <em>path</em> is
/// right from whether a particular set of rods produces a good field, and those
/// are different questions with different failure modes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The equation of motion it produces is the Mathieu equation, whose stability is
/// known in closed form. Spec section 19 calls recovering the a-q diagram "the
/// best single test that the RF path is correct", and this is the field that makes
/// that test about the integrator rather than about a mesh.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two dimensional and infinite along one axis, which is what a mass filter's
/// cross-section is. An ion drifts along the axis at whatever speed it was given
/// and the transverse motion does not care. The axis is z unless another is
/// given; a device whose beam runs along x - every axisymmetric tunnel here - puts
/// the quadrupole across x, and the transverse pair follows the cyclic order so
/// the potential is always <c>drive (u^2 - v^2) / r0^2</c> in that pair.
